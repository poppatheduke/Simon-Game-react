  <h1>How to play simon game</h1>

<p>
  First Press the Start button, immediately you do that
   you realize one of the button flashes. Press that button.
   After pressing that button another button flashes, so now it means you hav two flased buttons
   then you will have to press those two buttons after pressing those two buttons you realize a third button flashes
   it maybe the same colour as before or not. You keep doing this to increase your Level.
   when you disrupt the pattern its GAMEOVER.

   Have Fun!
